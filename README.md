Creating an object detection project with the help of yolov5 conventional neural network algorithm to detect objects.

STEPS INVOLVED IN BUILDING THIS MODEL:
1) Importing the Libraries
2) Installing Dependencies
3) Loading data
4) Preprocessing the data
5) Training the data
6) Prediction of model

The code is setting up an environment for working with image data (here object detection) , likely for tasks related to computer vision or data analysis.

Then we set up the environment for working with the YOLOv5 model by cloning its repository, installing necessary dependencies, and copying the requirements file for reference. The %%time magic command is used to measure how long this setup process takes.

Then we are preparing data for an object detection task, organizing images and their corresponding labels into separate directories for training and validation sets, and writing the necessary label information in specific text files. The code appears to be specific to a particular dataset and directory structure, so it might need modification to work with different data.

Then we finally write a code to pick a random picture from the testing_images and run it in the model and label the object with how much accurately is the object detected.
